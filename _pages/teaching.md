I spent half a year (Jan. 2018 - June 2018) living and studying in Finland. During that half-year, I also traveled to many other European countries, which made me love the feeling of enjoying different cultures and sceneries. I am looking forward to continuing my exploration in North America. Plus, I love watching tennis games (but I am not good at playing tennis...), and I am a big fan of Roger Federer! Sadly he retired in the year 2022 :(.
