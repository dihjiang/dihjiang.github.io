I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Waterloo, advised by Yaoliang Yu. Before that, I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Fudan University.

My doctoral research is mainly in studying trustworthy deep generative models, with applications in out-of-distribution detection and differential privacy. Before Ph.D., I have studied biomedical pattern recognition during my Master's research, with applications of EEG (electroencephalogram) in sleep.
